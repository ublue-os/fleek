fleek:
  use: "fleek"
  long: |
    Fleek installs and manages packages in your nix installation with a friendly and approachable config file.
    Fleek uses the power of `nix` and `home-manager` behind the scenes to give you access to the largest repository of packages in the world.

    Fleek hides the complexity of `nix` by giving you a CLI and YAML file to manage your installed applications.

    To get started, try `fleek init`.

apply:
  use: "apply"
  long: |
    Apply fleek configuration by reading the ~/.fleek.yml file, updating the flake templates, and applying the changes.

  warn: |
    Fleek uses `nix` behind the scenes to manage your configuration.

    `nix` will ignore any files in your configuration that are not tracked by
    git, or have been modified but not committed.

    You can choose to manually manage your git repository, or let fleek do some
    of the management for you.

    Either way, if your fleek configuration is in a git repository, fleek will
    automatically `git add`` any changes it makes to prevent surprises.

    Fleek will automatically set `pull.rebase = true` in your repository
    configuration to make sure your local changes are always applied on top of
    the latest remote changes.

    Set `git: autocommit: true` in your .fleek.yml file to have fleek automatically
    commit local changes to git.
    Set `git: autopush: true` in your .fleek.yml file to have fleek
    automatically push local changes to your remote repository.
    Set `git: autopull: true` in your .fleek.yml file to pull remote changes
    before any local changes are made.

    Recommendation:
      Edit your .fleek.yml file and set `git: autoadd: true` to have fleek
      automatically add local changes to git.
      Edit your .fleek.yml file and set `git: autopush: true` to have fleek
      automatically push local changes to your remote repository.
      Edit your .fleek.yml file and set `git: autopull: true` to have fleek
      automatically pull remote changes to your local repository.
